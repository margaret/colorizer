Python implementation of Berkeley [CS 194-26 proj1](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa14/hw/proj1/index.html): Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection

Just doing this for fun since I didn't get to take the class before graduating. 

Currently have a translation of the matlab boilerplate code.
